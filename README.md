Question Subject Line: CSC 275 Midterm Question
After pillaging for a few weeks with our new cargo bay upgrade, we decide to branch out into a new sector of space to explore and hopefully find new targets. We travel to the next star system over, another low security sector. After exploring the new star system for a few hours, we are hailed by a strange vessel. He sends us a message stating that he is a travelling merchant looking to purchase goods, and asks us if we would like to sell any extra weight we might have. We agree to sell him some items, however, we do not want to sell just anything, as some of our loot might have a better credit rate elsewhere. Unfortunately, we are unable to tell what kind of item is what, so we are unable to make the sale. On our way to the nearest space station we think of a way to classify the items in our cargo bay. We decide that it would be best to classify the items in our hold as equipables, consumable, weapons, and armor. When we arrive at the station, we create a clear hierarchy for all of our items. After fencing our loot, we decide to rest at this station for the night.
•	Items have attributes such as Name, Weight, Value, Durability and ID. (Create an object called ‘Item’) <-
•	We now classify our items by separating them into 3 distinct categories Equipable, Consumable or Weapon. (You must implement these 3 classes that are subclasses of Item and they must have at least 3 unique attributes in each subclass) <-
•	We can carry an unlimited number of items, as long as they don’t exceed the maximum weight of the cargo bay, 25 Tons. (Use an ArrayList that checks an item’s weight before placing it in the cargo hold)
•	We need to be able to add and remove items by their name.
•	We need to be able to search for a specific type of item in our cargo bay based on the item’s name and one of its attributes (Implement 2 searches – one on name and another on any attribute you choose).
•	We need to be able to sort items by their names alphabetically in descending order (A-Z)
•	We need to know how many of each item we have in our cargo bay and display their attributes.
•	We must also add a partial search (think of this as a ‘filter’ option).

No sample code is provided from this point on.
